# About Me

My name is **Mikhail Kozhevnikov**, I'm a **PHP Developer** and **Linux SysAdmin**. In my work I'm using **Symfony PHP Framework**, **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **Redis** and **Linux servers** (Debian, Ubuntu Server) as well.
I am interested in technologies in general, but most of all I am interested in **Linux** and any king of **Cloud** technologies.
In my free time I like cooking, watch streams, walking in parks and meet my friends. And also I love playing with my wonderful cat.
I have [twitter](https://twitter.com/MikhailKmm) and [vk](https://vk.com/id322723617), if you have any questions - you can use them or just write me on [telegram](@mikhail_kmm).

### Why I'm interested in that course?
1. At the beginning of last year, I became very interested in the DevOps methodology. As soon as I saw that Andersen was recruiting and hosting DevOps courses, I decided I want to try.
2. I am very interested in getting knowledge from professionals who have experience working on large projects as DevOps Engineers.
3. I think that this course will allow me to improve my English skills.

### What I expect from [Andersen](https://www.andersenlab.com/) DevOps courses?
1. Motivation to actively explore new technologies.
2. Get knowledge of the DevOps methodology and learn how to use it in practice.
3. At the end of the course, get a job offer or internship.
